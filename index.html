                    Resident Evil 7: Biohazard marks a significant shift in the long-running survival horror series by Capcom. 
                    Released in 2017, the game returned to its horror roots after the more action-oriented entries in the franchise. 
                    Set in the eerie, dilapidated Baker family estate in rural Louisiana, Resident Evil 7 introduces players to a new 
                    protagonist, Ethan Winters, who is searching for his missing wife, Mia. The game's first-person perspective, 
                    a departure from the traditional third-person view of previous titles, amplifies the intensity of the terrifying 
                    encounters with the grotesque Baker family and various mutated creatures. The game emphasizes exploration, 
                    puzzle-solving, and resource management, capturing the claustrophobic and tense atmosphere that defined the 
                    earlier Resident Evil games.
                    <br><br>
                    One of the standout aspects of Resident Evil 7 is its immersive atmosphere, enhanced by the first-person 
                    perspective and hauntingly detailed environments. The game cleverly uses lighting, sound, and jump scares 
                    to build dread as players navigate dark hallways and crumbling rooms filled with dangers lurking at every corner. 
                    The narrative intertwines with classic Resident Evil lore, gradually revealing the connections to the overarching 
                    storyline of the series. With its tight gameplay, gruesome visuals, and nerve-wracking tension, Resident Evil 7 
                    successfully revitalized the franchise, earning praise from both fans and critics for its bold return to survival horror.

                    The Resident Evil 2 remake, released in 2019, is a reimagining of Capcom's classic survival horror game from 1998.
                    With a complete overhaul in graphics, gameplay mechanics, and sound design, the remake offers a modernized experience 
                    while staying true to the original's core themes. Set in the decaying, zombie-infested Raccoon City, players control 
                    Leon S. Kennedy and Claire Redfield as they navigate the horrors of the city and uncover the mysteries behind the deadly
                    T-Virus outbreak. The game's shift to an over-the-shoulder perspective, combined with stunningly detailed environments 
                    and atmospheric lighting, heightens the sense of tension and dread, immersing players in a genuinely terrifying experience.
                    <br><br>
                    In addition to its visual and gameplay improvements, the Resident Evil 2 remake is praised for its intricate level design,
                    puzzle-solving elements, and deep storytelling. The game strikes a balance between intense combat sequences, where 
                    management is crucial, and moments of exploration, where every corner could hold potential danger. The characters
                    have been redefined with more depth and realism, adding emotional weight to their journey. Overall, the remake honors the
                    legacy of the original while pushing the boundaries of what a modern survival horror game can achieve, making it a 
                    must-play for both fans of the franchise and newcomers alike.
